            <h1>Test from Leo's awesome site</h1>

            <p>At the moment of writing, our ecosystem spans several major applications that are crucial for the day-to-day operations of the company.</p>

            <p>The list not only includes Now CLI and Now Desktop (which, along with our site, represents the most important entry points to our platform), but also projects like Hyper and Next.js - which eliminate all of the primary pain points you come across when building something online.</p>

            <p>Summa summarum: They're all equally important to us and we love working on them and pushing all of them into the direction of a even brighter future with the help of our community. ðŸ¤—</p>

            <p>That's also the reason why we're very excited whenever there's the time for a new feature or release: It's just a really great feeling to ship! ðŸ¤¤</p>

            <p>However, as the number of people that are using these apps keeps growing exponentially, a decision had to be made in order to preserve the stability of the code we actually hand out into the world - something that would ensure no friction is caused when publishing updates.</p>

            <p>As a result, we've decided to start publishing Canary Releases.</p>

            <p>In the following sentences, I'll talk about how we actually implemented this into three of our apps: Now CLI, Now Desktop and Hyper. If you haven't read the article about how to enable it yet, I highly recommend to do so first.</p>
